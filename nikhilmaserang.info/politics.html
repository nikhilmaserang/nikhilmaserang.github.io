				<p class="animate1">
					For many people, politics is a dirty word; a process which does nothing for them and isn't interesting to them.
					However, as Orwell said, '[in] our age there is no such thing as "keeping out of politics." All issues are policial issues', and I agree with him strongly.
					I think it's very important for a person to know what they think about the issues in our society and have reasons to think them.
					However, to me, this isn't the whole of politics: politics is about societal issues, yes, but it is also about the nature of society itself.
					At the <a target="_self" href="#Issues">very bottom of the page</a>, I've put links to my general political ideology as well as my thoughts on various individual issues,
					while right under this paragraph are my thoughts on what a society is, and what the best society would be.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate2">
					Over our evolutionary history, humanity has developed many different social and political structures,
					but the thread that runs through them all is that they're a joining of many disparate individuals into a single group.
					This happens because it is evolutionarily beneficial for people to join up and live in a society, rather than trying to survive on their own out in the wilderness:
					we are a cooperative species, after all, and our behavior reflects the fact that trying to go it alone often ended in a grisly death by the teeth of a large animal.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate3">
					And we group ourselves in many ways: in a country, there are states; in a state, there are regions or cities;
					in a city, there are neighborhoods; in neighborhoods, there are blocks with houses with families with individuals.
					We group ourselves as much as possible: we like to know who is in 'our group' and who is the 'other'.
					We break ourselves by race, ethnicity, class, gender, education, pop culture preferences (fanbases), and in every other way possible.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate4">
					This can be helpful and it can be hurtful.
					In the past, grouping behavior must have been helpful, because it survived and thrived through the mechanism of evolution, which is ruthless in eliminating detrimental behaviors.
					And it definitely is reassuring to meet a group of people which you fit into; who you can really connect to.
					Case in point, one of the first things you do when you move to a new location is create new social ties with various groups: gyms, libraries, hobbyist spaces, movie fanclubs, etc.
					But this grouping doesn't involve 'us' and 'them', only 'us', so it's pretty harmless.
					I don't walk down the street labeling people as 'library card-holders' or 'the other',
					and more specifically I don't see it as a defining characteristic of the person: I don't treat them differently because of it.
					Unfortunately, many people do walk down the street labeling people as "black" or "hispanic" or "asian" or "white" etc etc, 
					and they treat people differently based on that.
					They make broad generalizations about 'the other' which are extremely harmful as they lead to oppression within a society (racism) or conflict between societies (nationalism),
					and in my estimation the greatest thing humanity could do right now is to eliminate this idea of the 'other'.
					It no longer serves the purpose it did in the past, and it gets us into all sorts of trouble: war, genocide, discrimination, etc.
					These things just set us back, and the sooner we collectively realize that we share more than 99% of our DNA with each other,
					that we are all really just citizens of Earth, and that we all have similar goals, the better.
				</p>
					
				<p class="animate5">
					I digress. When people started creating groups which became established societies, they also created the famous 'social contract', where the society provides for the individual,
					while the individual agrees to work towards the benefit of the society.
					This generally means the society provides safety, stability, security, and help in times of need,
					while the individual agrees to certain restrictions on their freedom and to produce goods or other products.
					This is the basis of all societies, although the specifics vary.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate6">
					The eternal argument that rages is always the degree to which each party should provide for the other, and in what ways.
					The favored answer has traditionally depended on cultural norms,
					contemporary technological and scientific knowledge, population size, climate, and a whole host of other factors.
					It also is normally presumed to be 'universal', with the implication that there is an optimum social contract
					which is the same for every society and every set of circumstances, everywhere.
					I think this is ridiculous: am I to believe that
					the social contract best for the people of China in the 6th century
					is the same as the best one for the Inuit in the 12th century
					which is the one best for the people of France in 1980?
					Of course not. The best social contract for a group is hugely influenced by their circumstances;
					however, the goals of the social contract for each of those situations is the same.
					The society exists solely for the benefit of the individuals in it as a collective:
					not for the benefit of any one person, but to provide the greatest possible quality of life for everyone in general.
					Thus, the ideal social contract for a society is the one that provides the best quality of life for the people.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate7">
					What do I mean by quality of life? I mean stability, predictability, equality, equity, and compassion;
					political, religious, and social freedom;
					where people can dream of their goals <i>and then go on to achieve them</i>;
					where people have as much control over their own lives as possible with restrictions in place only to prevent them from infringing on the rights of others.
					This society should have a government which can be held accountable and can be changed as the circumstances change,
					should have laws that are clear and understandable, should provide the people equal voices,
					and should do pretty much everything possible to ensure the quality of life of its citizens.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate8">
					And that's the society I want to live in and want to work towards.
					Because it's clear that we aren't there yet, and it's equally clear that getting there must be the primary goal of every citizen,
					must be the primary goal of every government employee and government policy, in every government on the planet.
					Obviously, some states care more about projecting military power (USA) or censoring their citizens (China) or some thing which doesn't work towards the citizens' interest.
					Hopefully people will come to realize that a country isn't successful because it conquers other countries,
					or has a trade monopoly on a particular product, or makes technological breakthroughs,
					but is successful because its citizens are living high quality lives.
					When I think about the political issues in the list below, I look at the issue with the mindeset of "what policy creates the best quality of life for the population?"
					I want us to move towards being the "city on a hill" that the world looks to as an example.

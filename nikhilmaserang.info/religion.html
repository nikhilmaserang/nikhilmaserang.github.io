		<h1 class="animate0">My Thoughts On Religion</h1>
	
		<br>
	
		<h3>
			<p class="animate1">
				According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">Wikipedia</a>, "there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion", so for my purposes I will define it as a person's views on the nature of reality -
				the big questions: Why am I here? What exactly is here? How did here start existing? Where does here exist? etc etc.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate2">
				Personally, my worldview starts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsism</a>, which basically says that I can't prove that anything outside my mind exists.
				In other words, "I think, therefore I am".
				The world outside seems so real - the grass, the wind, the people, the places - but it could all be completely fictional and fabricated.
				Of course, it isn't practical to live our lives claiming nothing and nobody else is real, so to function in society we have to make some assumptions, like:
			</p>
			
			<ul class="animate3">
				<li>logical reasoning doesn't lead us to false conclusions</li>
				<li>our senses aren't deceiving us - what we see does truly exist where we see it</li>
				<li>other people are not automatons reacting in a way indistinguishable from how a 'real' person would act; they are sentient</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="animate4">
				Of course, we should always keep in the back of our minds the <i>possibility</i> that nothing else is real - that those assumptions are false - but seriously entertaining it and acting as though nobody else exists isn't a wise decision.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate5">
				Now, I actually used to call myself an atheist, until I realized that I had a fundamental issue with atheism: you need to have a considerable amount of faith to be an atheist.
				Allow me to clarify with an example:
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate6">
				Let's say that my religion holds that two omniscient and omnipotent Gods created the universe 13.7 billion years ago,
				with the exact initial conditions and rules of physics so that everything unfolds up to the present as it has, all the way up to me typing this document on my laptop.
				An atheist could neither prove nor disprove my beliefs, and if they asserted that my gods didn't exist they would be operating on just as much faith as me.
				It gets worse: what if my brother held a very similar belief but with one difference: he believed that in the beginning, there were three (rather than two) initial gods.
				The atheist could neither prove nor disprove my brother's beliefs either, and thus the three of us would be stuck arguing for our own positions: two gods, three gods, or no gods, with absolutely no evidence to speak of.
				We would all be operating on faith alone.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate7">
				I'd like to point out that atheists fact-checking creationists or pointing out contradictions in scripture is perfectly fine by me
				- I'm not saying that theist and atheist claims have the same amount of proof or validity - but the fact that
				some organized religions have been very decidedly and obviously wrong about some things doesn't prove by any means that every possible religion is wrong.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate8">
				Many atheists claim that they are using 100% facts and logic and there is no faith involved; many of them violently reject having even the label of 'religion' applied to atheism.
				However, in the words of David Eagleman, "we know too little to commit to atheism, and yet we know too much to commit to a particular religion."
				Both positions require faith, and as such I reject both of them as untenable.
				I respect those with faith, both the theist and atheist varieties (Life of Pi is one of my favorite books), and understand that it is a deeply personal decision affected by many factors - it just isn't the right path for me.
				However, although I respect the faithful, I do have to say that the flame wars between atheists and theists, which seem to appear to the participants to be titanic struggles between good and evil, are really quite silly, and should be avoided at all costs.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate9">
				So not atheist, not theist...where does this leave me?
				In the example above, an agnostic - normally hailed as a middle position between theism and atheism - would assert that the answer is unknowable.
				A logical positivist would go even further, saying that as it is unknowable, it is meaningless to pursue that avenue of thought.
				However, I don't feel at home in either of those camps.
				Agnosticism's doctrine of not accepting anything on faith alone seems to me rather bland,
				while my belief that the deep questions about reality are meaningful, even if we can't assert anything about the answers, disqualifies me from being a positivist.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate10">
				I was running out of options, but I fortunately stumbled onto a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LENqnjZGX0A">TED Talk</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eagleman">David Eagleman</a>
				about his philosophy, <a href="https://possibilian.com/">possibilianism</a>, which really resonated with me.
				My interpretation of possibilianism is as follows:
			</p>
			
			<ul class="animate11">
				<li>Human knowledge is like a pier extending into a vast ocean: we know a good deal about the world, but there is a great sea of knowledge we don't have yet.</li>
				<li>The deep waters beyond the point where the horizon meets the ocean is the great unknown; these are the things that we don't even know that we don't know.</li>
				<li>We know too much to commit to any particular religious doctrine, yet too little to commit to atheism; agnosticism is simply an expression of uncertainty, which is unsatisfactory.</li>
				<li>We can address this issue by creating a possibility space, where each point is a possibility, an idea about the universe.</li>
				<li>Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and all of the other traditional faiths each have a single point in our possibility space.</li>
				<li>Other worldviews, such as Andy Weir's <a href="http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">The Egg</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI">animated version</a>), <a href="http://www.last-thursday.org/">Last Thursdayism</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">Simulation Theory</a> each also get a single point in the possibility space.</li>
				<li>I like to imagine the possibility space as a spherical shell around me, because each point on the sphere is equidistant from me at the center, which symbolizes the equal consideration given to each point.</li>
				<li>Possibilianism is not "anything goes": a possibility is initially given fair consideration, but then we "import the tools of science" - data, reasoning, the scientific method, etc - to decide whether it fits the facts.</li>
				<li>Possibilianism is an "active exploration of the possibility space", and is about applying the scientific method to different ideas about reality.</li>
				<li>"Possibilianism reflects the scientific temperament of creativity, testing, and tolerance for multiple ideas."</li>
				<li>Possibilians are comfortable holding and considering multiple conflicting possibilities in their minds without knowing which is correct.</li>
				<li>"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one." - Voltaire</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="animate12">
				So I consider myself a possibilian.
				I think that we should use the scientific method to learn more about the world, and I think we should also consider the ideas that currently lie beyond the realm of science.
				Of course, we shouldn't <i>commit</i> to any particular idea without the data to support it, but we should be open to considering all ideas equally if we have equal supporting evidence for them.
				Some ideas will inevitably be superseded by others, either because of the existence of new evidence or the application of Occam's Razor (and other logical tools), and that's ok.
				It's all part of the possibilian mindset of being open to ideas and exploring the possibilities.

<!--OLD VERSION - DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO DELETE IT, SO IT'S COMMENTED OUT
	Religion and philosophy are really just a person's views on the nature of their experience in the world.
	Things like: What am I? Why am I here? What <i>is</i> here? etc.
	These questions are something that Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Taoists, Atheists, Agnostics,
	and <i>literally everyone else</i> have to wrestle with.
	The only difference between these groups is the answers they come up with,
	and because the objective answers to those questions are pretty much unknowable, it's ridiculous when people fight over who is right.

	The reason I say that the answers are unknowable is because in my experience, we can't actually really prove anything,
	because we ourselves are just a subjective consciousness; a brain in a jar made of meat and bones, so to speak.
	This is pretty much the fundamental tenet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>.
	This limitation means that all we know for sure is that we are thinking and experiencing,
	and so we have to make a lot of assumptions to get through life.
	We have to assume, for example, that we aren't the only real person in the universe;
	that the universe wasn't created at some arbitrary point in the past, set up as if it had been running for 13.7 billion years
	(<a href="http://www.last-thursday.org/">Last Thursdayism</a>); that we aren't living in some type of advanced simulation; etc.

	Sure, I could live my life questioning everything, all the time,
	but because the answers to many of those questions make little real difference to my everyday life,
	I feel comfortable making some assumptions.
	For example, even if the universe really was created last Thursday, <i>I</i> have no way of knowing if the universe will continue or not,
	and no power to really affect it in some meaningful way if it's going to end,
	so I'm just going to assume that I and everyone else are going to continue to exist, and carry on.
	Another example: some people might think that if they are the only 'real' person, they can do whatever they want.
	But even if the rest of the population are robots, they are still going to behave as if they are real,
	so there will always be repercussions for any actions I take; I can't just walk around robbing people, because I will go to jail.

	What this boils down to is that since the world seems to be so real, it's best to act as though it is.
	This doesn't mean that we shouldn't think about why things happen or about the nature of the universe:
	it just means we shouldn't have armed conflicts or aggressive arguments about who's right.
	This is where <a href="https://possibilian.com/">Possibilianism</a> comes in:
	We can look at all of the different possibilities in a type of 'possibility sphere',
	and use the principles of logic and probability to decide which ideas are the most likely.
	If some ideas are of similar probability, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>
	to determine which is better.

	This means that as a Possibilian, I don't say "There is no God" or "There is a God";
	I say "There might be a God, and it might even be the Christian God,
	but since there are so many possible Gods out there <span class="nowrap">(an infinite number, in fact)</span>, it seems rather hasty to pick one God over all the rest."
	Of course, we could consider Pascal's wager,
	which effectively states that you should believe in the God who gives out the harshest punishment to nonbelievers,
	but I'd rather take that risk and remain intellectually curious than give up like that.

	Really, a Possibilian is someone who is applying the scientific method to their philosophical beliefs;
	a person who is capable and willing to hold multiple possibilities at the same time and say "I don't know yet".
	As Stephen Hawking <span class="nowrap">(Rest In Peace)</span> pointed out, we can never <i>prove</i> a scientific theory.
	We can only try to find the best model to describe our world, and then keep testing it until it fails.
	At that point, we have to discard it or modify it and try to find a new, even better model.

	Something that bugs me is when people talk about our society going 'downhill'
	- having a complete loss of morality - as a result of the decline of traditional religion.
	In my view, this isn't a real concern,
	not only because I don't see religion as a great way to endow moral values <span class="nowrap">(see: the Holocaust; Imperialism)</span>,
	but also because people can definitely have morals without religion.
	A person's religion is their way of understanding the universe, and although many religions do espouse a particular code of behavior,
	being an atheist, an agnostic, or a possibilian in no way precludes having one.

	In my view, a moral value is really some general rule of thumb for behavior that helps society when a large amount of people hold it.
	For example, the greater the amount of people who believe murder is bad, the lesser the chance that someone will be murdered.
	My personal moral framework centers on what I call the 'Do No Harm Rule'; it's very simple: don't let your actions have a negative effect on the world.
	Of course, 'negative' is somewhat subjective, but we can just think of a negative action as being detrimental for a person or society in the generally understood way.
	No cheating by doing something horrible and pretending that it's helping society. <span class="nowrap">(<i>*ahem* Thanos</i>)</span>

	The fact that the world's religions are full of beautiful wisdom like "Love Thy Neighbor"
	and have truly inspirational founders and philosophers behind them, yet have followers which don't see this message as important,
	has really dissilusioned me with traditional organized religion.
	I know that many religious people will split their bread with the person who has none
	and go on missionary trips to impoverished places to lend a hand in helping these people's lives; in other words, they are model citizens and people of faith.
	However, in the United States, the majority of people are Christians, yet a minority act like true Christians,
	'feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, and tending to the sick'.
	We probably have the worst social support networks in the developed world,
	and the complete lack of action over this, and the overt nativism, racism, and bigotry which come out of many religious groups really frustrates me.

	I think the most important thing for humanity to do in the near future is realize that we all live on this relatively small blue orb,
	completely alone in the cosmos, and that the divisions between us are pretty much artificial and of our own making.
	Whether people come to this realization through organized religion, private spirituality, or some form of atheism, I don't really care.
	It just needs to happen before we tear ourselves apart.
	The movie trope is that humanity, having met with an extraterrestrial entity for the first time,
	finally understands that people have many more similarities than differences.
	Seeing as First Contact might not happen anytime soon, I hope we can do it before then.

	So this is my perspective on religion/life philosophy...I put a great deal of thought into it, so I hope you found it enlightening in some amount.
	Please be aware that I don't mean to offend anyone, and I think that if you are religious and you've found faith in something, that's good for you.
	Like Pi Patel, I'm a supporter of people finding their own spirituality in their own way, and as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, that's fine by me.

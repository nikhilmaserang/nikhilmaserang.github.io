		<h2 class="animate2">Overview</h2>

		<h3>
			<p class="animate3">
				I'm a high school senior who offers math and science tutoring/lessons for 6th-12th grades through Zoom.
				Learning new things as well as teaching others are two of my great passions, so I really put my heart and soul into them - I spend a considerable amount of time planning lessons and exploring how to best explain concepts so my lessons are intuitive and understandable.
			</p>
			<p class="animate4">
				I believe that people should know <i>why</i> they are learning what they are learning, as well as understand it at a very fundamental, conceptual level; they shouldn't solely know the steps and the order to follow them in.
				My goal is for students to genuinely enjoy coming to lessons with the prospect of learning new concepts and skills at their own pace, whether fast or slow.
			</p>
			<p class="animate5">
				I teach in three ways: I can follow the California Common Core curriculum for the student's grade level,
				or if the student is more advanced they can pick a topic which interests them (I have a list they can choose from),
				and if they have no preference I can choose something from the state curriculum to cover.
				After each lesson, I'll provide a write-up of what was covered during the lesson as well as supplemental exercises for the student to work on during the week until the next lesson.

			<p>
				Want to learn how to program in a comprehensive and practical way for $0.00? You're in the right place. Let's get started.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're starting from scratch, consider beginning with the <a href="#programming-basics">Programming Basics</a> series, which talks about coding concepts separately from any specific programming language.
				Once you've finished those, you can move on to one of the language-specific series to learn how to implement these ideas in actual code.
			</p>
			<p>
			If, on the other hand, you already have experience with programming and just want to make sure you haven't missed anything, or you just want a quick refresher, have a read through the <a href="#java">Java</a> or <a href="#python">Python</a> series (at this time, both of these series are going through a complete rewrite as I hated the old versions, but I also have to focus on school again so updates are going to be a lot slower).
			These will teach you the syntax of the language as well as more in-depth concepts than are covered in the programming basics section.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, I will possibly add a series on HTML/CSS (with an overview of how the internet actually works), a series on how the Windows command prompt and batch files work, a quick intro to LaTeX, and guides for popular python libraries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feedback is strongly encouraged and greatly appreciated, and can be submitted to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Nik3141/Nik3141.github.io/issues">GitHub Repository</a>.

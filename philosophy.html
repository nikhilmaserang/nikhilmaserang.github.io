			<p class="animate">
				I am an existential nihilist: I don't think that my life has any <i>intrinsic</i> or <i>built-in</i> meaning.
				I was born, and I don't really know why; I live, and I don't really know why; I will die, and I don't really know why.
				I sit here at my desk, writing this, and I know that at most a few hundred people will read it.
				It will almost certainly not change the world, and this is true of almost everything I have done or will ever do.

				I can turn around and look out my window at the hill bordering my neighborhood.
				Compared to the hill, I'm a speck, and the hill is but a speck on the continent, which is a fraction of the Earth's total size.
				The Earth itself, a giant compared to us, is literally nothing compared to the universe.
				My insignificance in the vastness of not just human society but also the Earth and the cosmos itself is absolutely incomprehensible, in that I have literally no way of even approaching an understanding of it.
				The universe is chaotic, unpredictable, and completely indifferent to my existence and, quite honestly, the existence of the entire human species.

			<p class="animate">
				Yet I keep writing; we humans tend to push on, trying to find meaning in the "unreasonable silence" of a meaningless world, to quote Camus.
				Our search for meaning in an unresponsive universe is the epitome of Absurdism.
				We are born, we suffer, and we die in an unknowable universe; 
				yet, we search on for meaning, making it wherever we go by uplifting the lives of ourselves and our fellow humans.
				We can do one thing: laugh.
				Maybe with a morbid and dark type of humor, but laugh nonetheless, at the dissonance we live in.

		<h2 class="animate">Morality</h2>
		
		<h3>
			<p class="animate">
				I used to think that I could create an objective and universal morality system - independent of any appeals to a higher justice or power - based solely on the idea of minimizing personal suffering.
				I reasoned that a person who wanted to minimize their own suffering would act in ways that also minize other people's suffering, because acting in ways that harm other people causes them to harm you back.
				If everyone tries to avoid harming other people for this reason, everyone will act in a traditionally 'moral' way, right?
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate">
				I was disabused of that notion pretty quickly when I was introduced to Hume's Sensible Knave.
				Basically, the Sensible Knave is a theoretical person who is normally law abiding, but acts out whenever it's possible to do so with nobody knowing.
				They're essentially the perfect criminal pulling off the perfect crime whenever they can do so with no consequences.
				Such a criminal could, for example, track down a vagabond that nobody has seen for years, kill them, and then resume their normal life, leaving no signs of their guilt or even that a crime had taken place.
				Since nobody would know that a crime has been committed, or even if they did know, they would have no clue who did it, there is no reason for the Knave to not commit the crime.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate">
				I tried to go around this by arguing that the Knave should surely know that committing murders or even lower level crimes would cause upset and unrest in the community,
				and this activity would likely increase the Knave's suffering; unfortunately, I didn't (and still don't) really find this counterargument very convincing.
			</p>
			
			<p class="animate">
				Suitably humbled, I decided that I would instead base my moral system around the idea that overall suffering should be minimized.
				I know that I don't like to suffer, and from all outward appearances other people don't like it either;
				it seems reasonable that minimizing it in my daily sphere as well as society as a whole is a worthwhile goal.

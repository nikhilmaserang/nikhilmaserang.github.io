		<p>Spectrum apparently doesn't let high schoolers interested in programming host their own websites on their own hardware in their own house, so for now I'm hosting my websites on this GitHub page.</p>
		<p>When/if I get this resolved, I'll migrate these pages over to my raspberry pi, but for now, they'll just live here.</p>
		<p>I can't guarantee that they'll always be completely up to date, but I'll try to update whenever I make significant progress.</p>

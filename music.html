			<br>
			
			<p class="animate1">
				<a id="music_list" href="music_list.html">This playlist</a> contains all of the classical music that I like listening to.
				By 'classical', I mean instrumental and choral works in the Western style from about 1600 to present day, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary periods.
				Right now, the playlist is pretty Eurocentric, so I've been trying to learn about 'classical' music from other cultures, so I can diversify it a bit.
				Some of the choral music from the Renaissance period is pretty epic too, so that's another area I'd like to expand into.
				I was inspired to create the playlist when I saw a 'Name that tune' playlist of pop music, but since I basically exclusively listened to classical at the time,
				I figured that I might as well make something similar but for classical.

			<p class="animate2">
				Like a lot of other people my age, I've played several video games which either really made an impression on me, had really good soundtracks, or both.
				I have a lot of really happy memories playing games like
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet">Little Big Planet</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Crawlers:_Innocent_Aces">Sky Crawlers</a>,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>,
				and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraria">Terraria</a>.
				The soundtracks for these games are sometimes good music by themselves, and other times they have a certain hit of nostalgia, but either way I sometimes like listening to them.
				That's pretty much why I made this playlist.

			<p class="animate3">
				I normally don't listen to modern music, but sometimes the mood strikes me, and that's why I have this playlist.

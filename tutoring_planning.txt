Order theory








U-sub, trig sub, partial fractions stuff, regular integration, integration by parts/tabular



group theory
group = set + operation
associative
identity
inverse

group homomorphism:
given (G, +) and (G', *)
f: G -> G'
f(x + y) = f(x) * f(y)

group isomorphism:
bijective homomorphism meaning that they are the same except for the names of the elements and operation
